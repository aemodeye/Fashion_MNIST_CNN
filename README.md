# Fashion_MNIST_CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset

#Requirements
The following is required to successfully run the project:
-Python 3.x
-TensorFlow
-Keras
-Matplotlib
-Numpy

Installations
* Usually tensorflow will not be installed by default so we use: pip install tensorflow
* Clone the repository or download the zip file

Usage
*Run the script
*You will observe that the model will train on the Fashion MNIST dataset and display the accuracy of the training.
*After the training, the model will predict two images based on what it has learnt and it will display the predicted image as compared the true image.

Dataset
*The Fashion NMIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories from 0-9.
*Each image is 28 x 28 pixels ranging from 0 - 255. Where 0 is black and 255 is white.

Results
The result simply outputs the test accuracy and displays the predicted labels for the two sample images.
